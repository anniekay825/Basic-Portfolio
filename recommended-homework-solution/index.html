      <p>Kathleen comes from a long-line of people who love to collect - and connect - dots. As a life-long learner,
        she has a high sense of curiosity for many interesting topics. From true crime to coding, she always seems
        to find new and interesting things to connect – and collect – along the way.</p>
      <p>Her curiosity began early as a girl scout in Manhattan, Kansas, and continued while enjoying an idyllic
        childhood in several college towns. After moving to Gainesville, FL before high school, her love of college
        football grew to an almost fanatic state (key word = almost), and she enjoyed attending and working at the
        University of Florida. </p>
      <p>Kathleen brought her curiosity and keen problem solving skills to the land of pirates, princesses, and
        policies over 15 years ago. She focuses on bringing her love of learning to interns around the world to
        share how we create happiness and unforgettable moments with our Guests.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Kathleen and her hubby Jack, welcomed two fun-loving fur babies to their family, and a beautiful
        grandbaby born on April 8th. Enjoying the love of travel, Kathleen & Jack, are avid cruisers and are
        always planning their next adventure. </p>
